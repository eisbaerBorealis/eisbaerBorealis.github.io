                "But seriously, if you like to play games, watch movies, read, eat tasty food/treats, need some extra benchwarmers on your team, or need someone to send your cat videos to, come find us!  Lauren is almost halfway through  her Masters of English degree at BYU, and Steven works at a startup here in Provo, so we will be around for a while. We're both local to Utah and like to hike, camp, and go on walks around town. Some of our favorite memories of the last three years we've been married have been made while we have been travelling, something we do as often as we can. Our favorite trips have been to parts of Europe, and to some of the National Parks around here. We are looking forward to seeing Japan early this summer. If anything that we mentioned sounds interesting to you, come find us, we love meeting new people!"

Colby is studying Therapeutic Recreation Management and Gerontology at BYU and Jesse is studying Computer Science at UVU.  Our go-to hang out spots when we leave the house are the Smiths grocery store and the Provo Temple.",

We’re also called as the new bulletin board managers, so we want to get to know you and show off your cute family on this board too."

We are <u><i>that</i></u> nerd family :) Rebecca studied paleontology at BYU paleontology museum having graduated from there with her masters. Jeremy is studying entomology at UVU and is currently working at Thanksgiving Point. We love going outside to hammock or hike or to just wander around looking for rocks and bugs! We also enjoy board games and good movies (like Lord of the Rings or marvel). Rebecca is originally from Massachusetts and Jeremy is from far away Provo Utah (he is so sad living so far from home). We met in the YSA Ward here in Provo, Jeremy was Rebecca's minister and FHE dad, so yeah we are pretty stereotypical.",

They shared their first kiss at their Senior Prom, and during Landen’s mission to Norway the couple wrote to each other every week.  Once reunited, Carly and Landen began dating again and have now shared a little over two years of marriage.",
                "Both are studying at BYU- Landen is working on undergraduate work in Geology where he is inspired by passionate professors, and Carly is pursuing the arts while working on a Bachelor’s degree in Art History.  The couple enjoys playing board games so hit them up if you have got an interesting game to share.  If you feel so inclined, you could pop by with some snickerdoodle or chocolate chip cookies and they would happily help you to clear the plate."
